# MS-AAI 530: Divvy Bikeshare Modeling

Group 2: Swapnil Patil, Carlos Ortiz, Douglas Code

## Description

This repository contains the implementation for three models based on the public Divvy bikeshare dataset:
* An autoencoder model for detection of anomalous bike rides (`src\anamoly_detection_model`)
* A random forest model for predicting the expected duration of a ride (`src\trip_duration_model`)
* An LSTM model for predicting the number of bike check-outs from a given station in upcoming days (`src\station_traffic_model`)
